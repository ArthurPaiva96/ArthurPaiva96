I’m Arthur Paiva, a new graduate in Computer Science(UFF - Universidade Federal Fluminense).

I did my internship at Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES) where I worked with Angular(Typescript) and Java. I also did black and white boxes, automated and manual tests.

My term paper was about a software I made to collect data about researchers and generate reports and visualizations with them. It can be seen [here](https://app.uff.br/riuff/handle/1/26700).

My github projects were made to help me learn something or are class projects.

I'm interested in mobile, back-end and game development(I hate searching for assets though).
